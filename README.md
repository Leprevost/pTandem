This is a simple yet efficient directory structure for analysing data with the Tandem software. The pTandem.pl script will handle all the input files and automatically run all of them in batch mode. Also, the script can be used to run Tandem in parallel mode.

	perl pTandem.pl <% number_of_thread %>
